 * reimplement constants once I've sorted out auth stuff <<< AppConstants.h:28 >>>
 * need to create login screen <<< AppDelegate.m:68 >>>
 * create "sortable" view for Workouts (substitute "a_creation_date" with sort numbers from settings doc) <<< AppDelegate.m:160 >>>
 * create "sortable" view for Exercises (substitute "a_creation_date" with sort order from settings doc) <<< AppDelegate.m:171 >>>
 * find out why the activityIndicator is always active... <<< AppDelegate.m:225 >>>
 * should probably relate to pre-fab exercises <<< M_Exercise.h:37 >>>
 * update all other CBLModels with similar edit logic <<< M_Settings.m:42 >>>
 * add in ability to edit `selectedExercise` <<< V_Exercise.m:133 >>>
 * properly implement `numberOfRowsInSection` <<< V_Set.m:207 >>>

 * change this test <<< vendor/Logging/LoggerClient.m:482 >>>
 * Make introspection for primitive types work. <<< vendor/PonyDebugger/ObjC/PonyDebugger/NSObject+PDRuntimePropertyDescriptor.m:195 >>>
 * maybe not copy this for performance <<< vendor/PonyDebugger/ObjC/SocketRocket/SocketRocket/SRWebSocket.m:719 >>>
 * Handle invalid opcode <<< vendor/PonyDebugger/ObjC/SocketRocket/SocketRocket/SRWebSocket.m:880 >>>
 * Optimize the crap out of this.  Don't really have to copy all the data each time <<< vendor/PonyDebugger/ObjC/SocketRocket/SocketRocket/SRWebSocket.m:1238 >>>
 * could probably optimize this with SIMD <<< vendor/PonyDebugger/ObjC/SocketRocket/SocketRocket/SRWebSocket.m:1358 >>>

### Open questions
 * find out if I need to change how I'm doing the IDs for each doc <<< AppConstants.h:14 >>>
 * look into `UICollectionView` <<< AppConstants.h:18 >>>
 * explore subclassing CBLLiveQuery UITableViewCell through `couchTableSource willUseCell forRow`? <<< AppConstants.h:22 >>>
 * change all emits to nil, use `prefetch=YES` in query instead (same as `include_docs=true`)? <<< AppDelegate.m:153 >>>
 * CBL prevents sorting with (BOOL)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView canMoveRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath, so address it <<< AppDelegate.m:172 >>>
 * I think these need to actually be `M_Workout` models? <<< M_Settings.h:28 >>>
 * not sure why delegate methods aren't being called... <<< V_Set.m:41 >>>
 * different way to deal with errors now? <<< V_Workout.m:141 >>>
 * need to make `moveRowAtIndexPath` actually get called! <<< V_Workout.m:190 >>>
 * *save* method seems to have changed (no longer *RestOperation*-based)? <<< V_Workout.m:232 >>>
